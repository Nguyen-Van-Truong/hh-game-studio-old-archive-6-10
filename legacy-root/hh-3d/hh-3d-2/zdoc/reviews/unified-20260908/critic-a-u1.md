I'll start with the freeze manifest, hash every listed file, then read the new plan in bounded chunks. No other critic reports.Hashing every freeze entry and the aggregate next, then reading the new plan in chunks. I will not open other critic reports.Hashes match. Continuing the plan and scanning history-file headings only for routing.Continuing the H2 specs, Q/EX registries, and checking path references plus P1-01 vs ST overlap.VERDICT=REVISE

Freeze-u1.json: 15/15 files SHA256 match listed values; algorithm `sha256(UTF8(sorted path + space + file sha256 joined LF, no final LF))` reproduces `manifest_sha256`. No frozen path missing. Plan-relative `../../hh-game-studio/hh-3d/hh-3d-2/...` and `./5-9`/`./8-9` history files resolve. `BASELINE_STUDIO=3cc7a85f…` and `BASELINE_SOCIAL=7162992…` exist as commits. History `zdoc/00–09`, `PROGRESS`, masters are HISTORY_ONLY/pointers to this TXT; one progress authority in the TXT table. Did not read critic B or other `reviews/` verdicts. No web fetch.

Coverage (self-contained in the TXT): 40 WP rows (32 H2 + 8 ST), all PLANNED; `CURRENT_VALID_WP=H2-P0-01`; 54 table dependency edges, acyclic; 40 BUILD/VERIFY/DoD specs; EX01–EX48; DB-D1–D4; Q00–Q06 plus Q04-P; `PLAN_ONLY` / `RUNTIME_ACCEPTANCE=NONE`. Adapter safety, Blender main-thread vs `--background` process, GLB byte pin vs semantic fingerprint, no remote eval, lease/idempotency/UNKNOWN-retry, Stop/process-tree, half-publish PREPARED→COMMITTED, generated `game/addons/hh_world_tools/` vs `studio/godot-addon/` source, and “no every-AI” until ST-07 are specified as future gates, not claimed done. Wave B (L1739–1741) lets representative 3D (ST-03→P1-03) proceed without P1-01/ST-04–08; P1-03 is not blocked by Godot editor-tooling. Game session CAS, attempt/quota one-winner, shop/house CAS, block visibility at commit, Solo≠Online namespaces are designed; SQL isolation names deferred.

HIGH blockers (fix in TXT, then re-freeze)

1. **P1-01 vs ST-05 / §2.5 (duplicate + impossible sequence)**  
   L1070: P1-01 BUILD `mục2.2–2.5 minimal operations`. L269–277 / L332–338: §2.5 is cross-app Blender+Godot journal publish. L1028–1029 assigns recovery/2.5 to ST-05 (`Không tick cùng deliverable hai lần`). Table L5: P1-01 depends only `H2-P0-03, ST-01` and is parallel with ST-02 (L1739–1740); P1-01 never depends on Blender.  
   Why: a worker can implement (or tick) half-publish in P1-01 without Blender, then skip or retick ST-05.  
   Minimal fix: P1-01 BUILD = §2.2–2.3 + **Godot-only** staged save/readback/UndoRedo; full PREPARED→COMMITTED/last-good stays ST-05. Keep L1028 split.

2. **P1-01 vs ST-01 protocol tree**  
   L292: ST-01 ALLOWED `studio/protocol/`. L1069: P1-01 ALLOWED `studio/protocol/ Godot schemas`. L1028: `ST-01 protocol`. Same directory, two owners.  
   Why: dual lease on the protocol source of truth; risk of reticking discovery/schema DoD inside P1-01.  
   Minimal fix: P1-01 ALLOWED drop `studio/protocol/`; Godot operation catalog under `studio/godot-addon/` (or `studio/protocol/godot/` created only in ST-01 as reserved, not P1-01-owned).

3. **P1-01 vs ST-04 observe/play (omitted from the split)**  
   L1071: P1-01 `owner toolbar run/pause/stop/read scene`. L321–328: ST-04 owns inspect/play/pause/stop/capture/review; DoD cites EX28/41. L1028 lists ST-01/02/03/05, not ST-04.  
   Why: same Play/pause/stop evidence can be ticked twice, or ST-04 reduced to a no-op.  
   Minimal fix: P1-01 proves editor mutation + **process split** Editor vs Play (no official input-trace/capture DoD). ST-04 exclusive for real-input pause-clock, capture, reviewer UI. Add ST-04 to L1028.

Small (not blocking ACCEPT if 1–3 fixed)

- L1108 `assets-source` vs L150 `assets-src/` — one tree name.  
- L300 vs L144: ST-03 `studio/pipeline/` not in §2.1 tree; add it (and `studio/package/` for ST-08).  
- L1261 leftover English after P6-02 DoD.  
- `zdoc/06-ROADMAP.md` body still says `PLAN_ROLE=CANONICAL_…` under HISTORY_ONLY; routing already defers to TXT.  
- Name DB isolation (`SELECT FOR UPDATE` / SERIALIZABLE) at P3-01; current “khóa bản ghi + CAS” is enough as a target.

Unverified (explicitly deferred; not PLAN_DESIGN FAIL): live Godot 4.7.2 / Blender 5.2.1 artifacts (S01–S06, P0-01); PG/Godot/Blender page bodies not re-fetched; runtime, devices, humans, installs; no code proof required.

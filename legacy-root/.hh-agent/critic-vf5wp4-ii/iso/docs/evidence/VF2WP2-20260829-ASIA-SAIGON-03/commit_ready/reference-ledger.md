# Vault Fighters — reference ledger

This file is the product provenance and **behavior observation** ledger.
Timezone: **Asia/Saigon**. Display title remains **Vault Fighters**.
This document does **not** claim Y8 parity, V0–V6, R9-WP4, G6, GX, or 60/60.

**Citation rule (DoD VF1-WP1):** every later tuning or “Y8-like” claim
must point at a row ID in this file (`ledger:RL-…`). Rows without
`observed` class are not live play proof (V-A19 / V-A20).

## Product identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Display title (on-screen) | **Vault Fighters** |
| Product folder | `godot/dogfood/superfighters/` |
| Engine pin | Godot **4.7.1-stable** stock (`4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`) |
| Frozen first-playable HEAD | `094822467edfe97d20f99890366a0103dc93b9b1` |
| Ledger WP HEAD (pre-commit) | `5ec84bb59551261fa774c31dabc4db6c0ac44c3e` |
| Product tree at that HEAD | `9b05a2c299e42fd46ea7aecbf211d67aec2e7440` |
| Working title vs trademark | Folder name `superfighters` is historical path only. Title card, fighter names, map display names, and ship metadata must not say Superfighters / Super Fighter. |

Title-card check: `src/ui/title_screen.gd` sets `TitleLabel` to
`Vault Fighters`. Subtitle is `2D arena deathmatch — last standing wins`.

## New-folder decision (VF0 seed, unchanged)

| Decision | Status | Meaning for this product |
|---|---|---|
| `GODOT-VF-Y8-2026-08-28` | owner-direction | New folder; Vault Fighters; Y8 Superfighters is the **behavior/topology reference**, not a rip source; parent R9-WP4 / G6 / GX / 60/60 stay frozen. |
| `GODOT-VF-PLAN-2026-08-29` | owner-direction | Product authority is `zdocs/29-8-vault-fighters-y8-parity-plan.txt`. |

Parent platform (do not open or tick from this product):
`CURRENT_VALID_WP=R9-WP4` on the 20-8 plan; 59/60; G6 `[ ]`; GX `[ ]`.

## Clean-room status

**Allowed:** observe publicly documented listing/developer/wiki **page
text** to learn mechanics, controls, modes, and functional map beats.

**Forbidden:** download, rip, trace, reverse-engineer, bundle, or ship
Y8 / Newgrounds / MythoLogic / wiki **packages, SWF, Flash, HTML5
builds, sprites, audio, code, screenshots, or trademarked title
cards**. Network is not a runtime dependency.

**This session (VF1-WP1, 2026-08-29):** listing HTML and archive/search
text only. The Y8 page exposes an HTML5 iframe `data-src` on
`html5.gamedistribution.com`. **That embed was not fetched.** No SWF,
no screenshot, no title-card image is stored.

**Clean-room state label:** `in_force`.

## Behavior rows

Numbers that are not on a cited page are **tuning targets**, not
invariants. Calibrate later with traces (VF1-WP3+).

### Controls

| RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM | Hold aim, release fire | `assumption` | low | not on live listing; first-playable `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` | 2026-08-29 | Do **not** cite as observed.

| RL-MODE-CHAOS | Random spawns / crits | `secondary` | med | RL-SRC-NG-INDEX developer note | 2026-08-29 | Player/weapon/object spawns and gun crits described as random | tables | “IT AIN'T FAIR” is designer intent, not a RNG spec. |
| RL-MODE-TEAMS-AI | Teams vs AI, 1 life/round | `secondary` | med | 2011 Y8 archive description | 2026-08-29 | Teams of player + computer; 1 life per round | stock lives | Live 2026 blurb does not repeat “1 life per round”. |

### Maps / landmarks

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-MAP-CHOOSE | Choose stages | `observed` | med | live Y8 “choose from different heroes, stages, and weapons” | 2026-08-29 10:23 +07 | Multiple stages exist | count | Names not on the live listing. |
| RL-MAP-COUNT-4 | Four maps (2011 NG) | `secondary` | med | RL-SRC-NG-INDEX “13 weapons and 4 maps” | 2026-08-29 | Early public build had 4 maps | — | Conflicts with 6-name wiki list; both are secondary. |
| RL-MAP-COUNT-6 | Six named arenas | `secondary` | med | RL-SRC-WIKI-INDEX | 2026-08-29 | Functional archetypes: Storage, Rooftops, Police Station, Hazardous, Backstreets, Testing Floor | geometry | **Names are reference archetypes only.** VF display names must be original (plan §3.3). |

Do not claim observed rooftop/warehouse coordinates. |

### Item / combat loop

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-ITEM-GRAB-GUNS | Grab guns, shoot, last standing | `observed` | med | live Y8 “intense shooting” / “survive in the chaotic arenas” plus 2011 “grab guns … blast the AI” | 2026-08-29 | Pickup + shoot + arena survival | — | Win condition “last standing” is first-playable + plan, not a live Y8 sentence. |
| RL-ITEM-13-WEAPONS | 13 weapons (2011) | `secondary` | med | RL-SRC-NG-INDEX | 2026-08-29 | Broad roster, not fists-only | which 13 | First-playable roster is smaller (fists/pistol/uzi/shotgun/pipe/knife/grenade). |
| RL-ITEM-RANDOM-SPAWN | Random weapon/object spawn | `secondary` | med | RL-SRC-NG-INDEX | 2026-08-29 | Spawns are not a fixed fair draft | period, tables | `maps.gd` `WEAPON_RESPAWN = 20.0` is a **tuning target**, not observed. |

| RL-ITEM-BOX2D | Box2D spectacle | `secondary` | low | RL-SRC-NG-INDEX | 2026-08-29 | Physics debris/gibs were a reference feature | — | Product uses Godot physics; no Box2D rip. Not a VF1-WP1 ship claim. |

### Special movement

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-MOVE-BASIC | Move / punch / shoot / throw | `observed` | high | live Y8 control block | 2026-08-29 10:24 +07 | Those four actions exist for P1 | — | Jump/crouch not named on the live block (arrows only). |
| RL-MOVE-JUMP-CROUCH | Jump / crouch on vertical | `assumption` | low | first-playable + plan VF2; not labeled on live Y8 | 2026-08-29 | Up/down often mean jump/crouch **and** aim | coyote, crouch AABB | Deferred to VF2 with a new dated row after play or a better secondary. |

## Delta table (legal / original product)

| ID | Keep or change | Item | Product now / later | Legal or product reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-DELTA-TITLE | **Change** | Game title | **Vault Fighters** on title card and `project.godot` `config_name` | Do not ship Superfighters / Super Fighter as product name. |
| RL-DELTA-SKINS | **Change** | Fighter look / names | Original helmet-crew skins; no Jeff/Funnyman/etc. | No character or sprite rip. |
| RL-DELTA-AUDIO | **Change** | Music / SFX | Procedural original tones (`NOTICE.md`) | No Y8/Newgrounds audio rip. |
| RL-DELTA-ENGINE | **Change** | Runtime | Godot 4.7.1-stable Windows | Reference is Flash/HTML5 browser; not a dependency. |
| RL-DELTA-MAP-NAMES | **Change** | Display map names | First-playable still echoes Rooftops / Storage / Police Station / Hazardous. **VF5 must replace display names.** | Plan §3.3: names must be original. Echo names are a known honesty debt, not a VF1-WP1 rename. |
| RL-DELTA-MAP-GEO | **Change** | Coordinates, landmarks, tiles | Echo functional beats (pit, ladder, cover, platforms); original tiles and grids | No collision-map rip. If a later pass is too close for commercial release, stop for legal review. Agents must not self-certify fair use. |
| RL-DELTA-LOOP | **Keep** | Side-view chaotic arena; guns + melee + nades; 1P/2P; PVP/PVE | Functional target for VF2–VF6 | Mechanics/genre ideas; not assets. |
| RL-DELTA-CTRL-LAYOUT | **Keep (intent)** | Split keyboard P1 arrows+N/M/, P2 WASD+1/2/3 | Already in `input_actions.gd` | Cite RL-CTRL-* . Hold-to-aim stays assumption (RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM). |
| RL-DELTA-PHYSICS | **Change** | Box2D gibs / exact Flash sim | Godot 2D physics, original VFX | No engine or binary rip. |
| RL-DELTA-DELUXE | **Out of scope** | Superfighters Deluxe / online | Not this product | Sequel is a different work. |

## How later WPs must extend this file

Append dated rows with:

- URL, Asia/Saigon datetime, page/version status
- `observed` / `secondary` (`reported`) / `assumption` / `unavailable`
- behavior to reproduce vs tuning-only numbers
- intentional original deltas
- hash of the related spec/trace — **no reference assets**

If a play observation becomes legal (public page only, no package saved),
add a new `observed` row. Do not back-date this session as play.

Until a row is `observed` or a calibrated trace exists, no agent may
claim Y8 parity for that behavior.

---

## VF0 notes (not Y8 observation)

VF0-WP1 seeded this file and deferred URL observation to VF1-WP1.
VF0-WP2 headless `tests/run_all.gd` uses `App.test_driven` →
`SfxBank.muted` so the official process does not load `AudioStream`
resources. That is hygiene, not parity.

---

## Honesty / gaps (VF1-WP1)

- Live Y8 **keys** are from listing CSS classes, not from playing.
- Newgrounds live page blocked (403). Developer blurb is a search excerpt.
- MythoLogic `/Superfighters` is a live **Page not found** / empty shell.
- Wiki map page blocked (403). Six names are a snippet, not a layout study.
- Special movement (sprint/roll/dive/kick/ledge) **not observed**.
- Camera framing **not observed**.
- Item respawn `20s` is first-playable tuning, not observed.
- Parent 20-8 unchanged: R9-WP4 `[ ]`, 59/60, G6 `[ ]`.

## VF1-WP2 simulation contract (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. `src/sim/` and `data/sim/` are a **product** clock/schema so
later WPs can replay. Sidecar: `docs/sim-contract.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF1WP2-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-SIM-FIXED-60 | Fixed 60 Hz accumulator | `assumption` | none | product V-A14; **not** on Y8 listing | 2026-08-29 | Gameplay ticks at 1/60; pause/resume must not jump tick | catch-up cap=8 | **Not a Y8 tick-rate claim.** Do not promote to `observed` without a dated play row. |
| RL-SIM-INPUT-FRAME | InputFrame tick/held/pressed/released | `assumption` | none | V-A14 + first-playable `input_actions.gd` | 2026-08-29 | One frame per fighter per tick; malformed rejected | — | Action names map listing keys via RL-CTRL-*. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. Roll/dive stay RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE and are rejected if sent. |

How later WPs must cite: `ledger:RL-SIM-FIXED-60` for the clock,
`ledger:RL-CTRL-*` for keys, never “60 Hz like Y8”.

## VF1-WP3 golden traces (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. Official traces are product InputFrames so a parity bug can be
recorded and replayed. Sidecar: `docs/trace-harness.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF1WP3-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-SIM-TRACE-REPLAY | Official InputFrame record/replay | `assumption` | none | V-A14 + VF1-WP2 contract | 2026-08-29 | Same seed+frames → same snapshot/event hashes twice; one key change fails; official forbids teleport/force_kill | snapshot_every=15 | Not Y8 parity. Clock stays RL-SIM-FIXED-60. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. Roll/dive stay RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE. |

## VF1-WP4 runtime observe (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. `src/runtime/` is a **product** observe/checkpoint API so an
agent can read structured state. Sidecar: `docs/runtime-diagnostics.md`
and `docs/evidence/VF1WP4-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-RUNTIME-OBSERVE | Structured observe + checkpoint | `assumption` | none | V-A8 / V-A10 / VF1-WP2 snapshot | 2026-08-29 | observe is read-only; pause keeps snapshot hash; restore hash matches capture; unauthorized/malformed do not mutate | — | Not Y8 parity. Clock stays RL-SIM-FIXED-60. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. Roll/dive stay RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE. Prop events empty in this slice. |

## VF2-WP1 product input map (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. Sidecar: `docs/input-mapping.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF2WP1-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

Listing keys stay `observed` from VF1-WP1 (`ledger:RL-CTRL-P1-*` /
`ledger:RL-CTRL-P2-*`). The rows below are **product** mapping rules
so P1/P2 and gamepad can be tested with real `InputEvent`s.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-CTRL-DEADZONE | Analog dead-zone | `assumption` | none | VF2-WP1 product map; **not** on Y8 listing | 2026-08-29 | Stick values below 0.25 do not become held left/right | 0.25 | Not a Y8 stick claim. Clock stays RL-SIM-FIXED-60. |
| RL-CTRL-DEVICE-SPLIT | P1 pad 0 / P2 pad 1 | `assumption` | none | VF2-WP1; keyboard split is RL-CTRL-P1-MOVE + RL-CTRL-P2-MOVE | 2026-08-29 | Device-0 joy must not fill P2 InputFrame; device-1 must not fill P1 | — | Keyboard still arrows vs WASD. Do not mark observed. |
| RL-CTRL-REMAP | Atomic remap persist | `assumption` | none | V-A13 + title/pause Controls UI | 2026-08-29 | temp+rename; schema hash stored; F11 rejected; same-device payload rejected | — | Not Y8. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. |
| RL-CTRL-SYNTH-PAD | Synthetic non-hardware pad | `assumption` | none | VF2-WP1 verify when no hardware | 2026-08-29 | Official inject uses InputEventJoypad* marked non-hardware | — | Hardware smoke is extra if a pad is connected; golden trace stays synthetic. |

Hold-to-aim is still `ledger:RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM` (`assumption`). VF1-WP1
did **not** observe hold-to-aim or roll. Roll/dive stay
`ledger:RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE` (`unavailable`). 60 Hz stays
`ledger:RL-SIM-FIXED-60` (`assumption`).

## VF2-WP2 locomotion baseline (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. Sidecar: `docs/locomotion.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF2WP2-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-03/`.

Jump / crouch stay `ledger:RL-MOVE-JUMP-CROUCH` (`assumption`) — VF1-WP1
did not observe them; this WP does **not** promote the class. Camera
stays `ledger:RL-CAM-ARENA` (`assumption`). Hold-to-aim stays
`ledger:RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM` (`assumption`). Roll/dive stay
`ledger:RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE` (`unavailable`). 60 Hz stays
`ledger:RL-SIM-FIXED-60` (`assumption`).

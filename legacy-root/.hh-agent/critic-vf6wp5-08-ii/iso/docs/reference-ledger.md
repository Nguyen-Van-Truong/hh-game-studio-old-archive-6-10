# Vault Fighters — reference ledger

This file is the product provenance and **behavior observation** ledger.
Timezone: **Asia/Saigon**. Display title remains **Vault Fighters**.
This document does **not** claim Y8 parity, V0–V6, R9-WP4, G6, GX, or 60/60.

**Citation rule (DoD VF1-WP1):** every later tuning or “Y8-like” claim
must point at a row ID in this file (`ledger:RL-…`). Rows without
`observed` class are not live play proof (V-A19 / V-A20).

## Product identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Display title (on-screen) | **Vault Fighters** |
| Product folder | `godot/dogfood/superfighters/` |
| Engine pin | Godot **4.7.1-stable** stock (`4.7.1.stable.official.a13da4feb`) |
| Frozen first-playable HEAD | `094822467edfe97d20f99890366a0103dc93b9b1` |
| Ledger WP HEAD (pre-commit) | `5ec84bb59551261fa774c31dabc4db6c0ac44c3e` |
| Product tree at that HEAD | `9b05a2c299e42fd46ea7aecbf211d67aec2e7440` |
| Working title vs trademark | Folder name `superfighters` is historical path only. Title card, fighter names, map display names, and ship metadata must not say Superfighters / Super Fighter. |

Title-card check: `src/ui/title_screen.gd` sets `TitleLabel` to
`Vault Fighters`. Subtitle is `2D arena deathmatch — last standing wins`.

## New-folder decision (VF0 seed, unchanged)

| Decision | Status | Meaning for this product |
|---|---|---|
| `GODOT-VF-Y8-2026-08-28` | owner-direction | New folder; Vault Fighters; Y8 Superfighters is the **behavior/topology reference**, not a rip source; parent R9-WP4 / G6 / GX / 60/60 stay frozen. |
| `GODOT-VF-PLAN-2026-08-29` | owner-direction | Product authority is `zdocs/29-8-vault-fighters-y8-parity-plan.txt`. |

Parent platform (do not open or tick from this product):
`CURRENT_VALID_WP=R9-WP4` on the 20-8 plan; 59/60; G6 `[ ]`; GX `[ ]`.

## Clean-room status

**Allowed:** observe publicly documented listing/developer/wiki **page
text** to learn mechanics, controls, modes, and functional map beats.

**Forbidden:** download, rip, trace, reverse-engineer, bundle, or ship
Y8 / Newgrounds / MythoLogic / wiki **packages, SWF, Flash, HTML5
builds, sprites, audio, code, screenshots, or trademarked title
cards**. Network is not a runtime dependency.

**This session (VF1-WP1, 2026-08-29):** listing HTML and archive/search
text only. The Y8 page exposes an HTML5 iframe `data-src` on
`html5.gamedistribution.com`. **That embed was not fetched.** No SWF,
no screenshot, no title-card image is stored.

**Clean-room state label:** `in_force`.

### Special movement

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-MOVE-BASIC | Move / punch / shoot / throw | `observed` | high | live Y8 control block | 2026-08-29 10:24 +07 | Those four actions exist for P1 | — | Jump/crouch not named on the live block (arrows only). |

## Delta table (legal / original product)

| ID | Keep or change | Item | Product now / later | Legal or product reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-DELTA-TITLE | **Change** | Game title | **Vault Fighters** on title card and `project.godot` `config_name` | Do not ship Superfighters / Super Fighter as product name. |
| RL-DELTA-SKINS | **Change** | Fighter look / names | Original helmet-crew skins; no Jeff/Funnyman/etc. | No character or sprite rip. |
| RL-DELTA-AUDIO | **Change** | Music / SFX | Procedural original tones (`NOTICE.md`) | No Y8/Newgrounds audio rip. |
| RL-DELTA-ENGINE | **Change** | Runtime | Godot 4.7.1-stable Windows | Reference is Flash/HTML5 browser; not a dependency. |
| RL-DELTA-MAP-NAMES | **Change** | Display map names | Rooftops display is **Skyline Relay** (VF5-WP2). Storage display is **Pallet Annex** (VF5-WP3). Police display is **Signal Court** (VF5-WP4). Hazardous display is **Vitriol Sump** (VF5-WP5). Lantern display is **Lantern Cut** (VF5-WP6). Gauge display is **Gauge Deck** (VF5-WP6). | Plan §3.3: names must be original. Internal ids stay rooftops/storage/police/hazardous/lantern/gauge. |
| RL-DELTA-MAP-GEO | **Change** | Coordinates, landmarks, tiles | Echo functional beats (pit, ladder, cover, platforms); original tiles and grids | No collision-map rip. If a later pass is too close for commercial release, stop for legal review. Agents must not self-certify fair use. |
| RL-DELTA-LOOP | **Keep** | Side-view chaotic arena; guns + melee + nades; 1P/2P; PVP/PVE | Functional target for VF2–VF6 | Mechanics/genre ideas; not assets. |
| RL-DELTA-CTRL-LAYOUT | **Keep (intent)** | Split keyboard P1 arrows+N/M/, P2 WASD+1/2/3 | Already in `input_actions.gd` | Cite RL-CTRL-* . Hold-to-aim stays assumption (RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM). |
| RL-DELTA-PHYSICS | **Change** | Box2D gibs / exact Flash sim | Godot 2D physics, original VFX | No engine or binary rip. |
| RL-DELTA-DELUXE | **Out of scope** | Superfighters Deluxe / online | Not this product | Sequel is a different work. |

## How later WPs must extend this file

Append dated rows with:

- URL, Asia/Saigon datetime, page/version status
- `observed` / `secondary` (`reported`) / `assumption` / `unavailable`
- behavior to reproduce vs tuning-only numbers
- intentional original deltas
- hash of the related spec/trace — **no reference assets**

If a play observation becomes legal (public page only, no package saved),
add a new `observed` row. Do not back-date this session as play.

Until a row is `observed` or a calibrated trace exists, no agent may
claim Y8 parity for that behavior.

---

## VF0 notes (not Y8 observation)

VF0-WP1 seeded this file and deferred URL observation to VF1-WP1.
VF0-WP2 headless `tests/run_all.gd` uses `App.test_driven` →
`SfxBank.muted` so the official process does not load `AudioStream`
resources. That is hygiene, not parity.

---

## Honesty / gaps (VF1-WP1)

- Live Y8 **keys** are from listing CSS classes, not from playing.
- Newgrounds live page blocked (403). Developer blurb is a search excerpt.
- MythoLogic `/Superfighters` is a live **Page not found** / empty shell.
- Wiki map page blocked (403). Six names are a snippet, not a layout study.
- Special movement (sprint/roll/dive/kick/ledge) **not observed**.
- Camera framing **not observed**.
- Item respawn `20s` is first-playable tuning, not observed.
- Parent 20-8 unchanged: R9-WP4 `[ ]`, 59/60, G6 `[ ]`.

## VF1-WP2 simulation contract (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. `src/sim/` and `data/sim/` are a **product** clock/schema so
later WPs can replay. Sidecar: `docs/sim-contract.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF1WP2-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-SIM-FIXED-60 | Fixed 60 Hz accumulator | `assumption` | none | product V-A14; **not** on Y8 listing | 2026-08-29 | Gameplay ticks at 1/60; pause/resume must not jump tick | catch-up cap=8 | **Not a Y8 tick-rate claim.** Do not promote to `observed` without a dated play row. |
| RL-SIM-INPUT-FRAME | InputFrame tick/held/pressed/released | `assumption` | none | V-A14 + first-playable `input_actions.gd` | 2026-08-29 | One frame per fighter per tick; malformed rejected | — | Action names map listing keys via RL-CTRL-*. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. Roll/dive stay RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE and are rejected if sent. |

How later WPs must cite: `ledger:RL-SIM-FIXED-60` for the clock,
`ledger:RL-CTRL-*` for keys, never “60 Hz like Y8”.

## VF1-WP3 golden traces (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. Official traces are product InputFrames so a parity bug can be
recorded and replayed. Sidecar: `docs/trace-harness.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF1WP3-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-SIM-TRACE-REPLAY | Official InputFrame record/replay | `assumption` | none | V-A14 + VF1-WP2 contract | 2026-08-29 | Same seed+frames → same snapshot/event hashes twice; one key change fails; official forbids teleport/force_kill | snapshot_every=15 | Not Y8 parity. Clock stays RL-SIM-FIXED-60. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. Roll/dive stay RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE. |

## VF1-WP4 runtime observe (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. `src/runtime/` is a **product** observe/checkpoint API so an
agent can read structured state. Sidecar: `docs/runtime-diagnostics.md`
and `docs/evidence/VF1WP4-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-RUNTIME-OBSERVE | Structured observe + checkpoint | `assumption` | none | V-A8 / V-A10 / VF1-WP2 snapshot | 2026-08-29 | observe is read-only; pause keeps snapshot hash; restore hash matches capture; unauthorized/malformed do not mutate | — | Not Y8 parity. Clock stays RL-SIM-FIXED-60. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. Roll/dive stay RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE. Prop events empty in this slice. |

## VF2-WP1 product input map (not a play observation)

Dated 2026-08-29 Asia/Saigon. No in-game Y8 play. No HTML5/Flash
package. Sidecar: `docs/input-mapping.md` and
`docs/evidence/VF2WP1-20260829-ASIA-SAIGON-01/`.

Listing keys stay `observed` from VF1-WP1 (`ledger:RL-CTRL-P1-*` /
`ledger:RL-CTRL-P2-*`). The rows below are **product** mapping rules
so P1/P2 and gamepad can be tested with real `InputEvent`s.

| ID | Topic | Class | Conf. | Source | When | Behavior to reproduce | Tuning-only | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RL-CTRL-DEADZONE | Analog dead-zone | `assumption` | none | VF2-WP1 product map; **not** on Y8 listing | 2026-08-29 | Stick values below 0.25 do not become held left/right | 0.25 | Not a Y8 stick claim. Clock stays RL-SIM-FIXED-60. |
| RL-CTRL-DEVICE-SPLIT | P1 pad 0 / P2 pad 1 | `assumption` | none | VF2-WP1; keyboard split is RL-CTRL-P1-MOVE + RL-CTRL-P2-MOVE | 2026-08-29 | Device-0 joy must not fill P2 InputFrame; device-1 must not fill P1 | — | Keyboard still arrows vs WASD. Do not mark observed. |
| RL-CTRL-REMAP | Atomic remap persist | `assumption` | none | V-A13 + title/pause Controls UI | 2026-08-29 | temp+rename; schema hash stored; F11 rejected; same-device payload rejected | — | Not Y8. Hold-to-aim stays RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM. |
| RL-CTRL-SYNTH-PAD | Synthetic non-hardware pad | `assumption` | none | VF2-WP1 verify when no hardware | 2026-08-29 | Official inject uses InputEventJoypad* marked non-hardware | — | Hardware smoke is extra if a pad is connected; golden trace stays synthetic. |

Hold-to-aim is still `ledger:RL-CTRL-HOLD-AIM` (`assumption`). VF1-WP1
did **not** observe hold-to-aim or roll. Roll/dive stay
`ledger:RL-MOVE-ROLL-DIVE` (`unavailable`). 60 Hz stays
`ledger:RL-SIM-FIXED-60` (`assumption`).

Product contract: double-tap same direction inside `tap_window`
starts sprint and drains stamina; crouch-while-sprint or InputFrame
`roll` starts a grounded roll with a distinct AABB, invuln window,
animation / SFX / HUD / VFX, and an `extinguish_fire` hook. Dead,
paused, airborne, aiming, ladder, already-rolling, and low-stamina
inputs do not start a roll. A second roll press during the same seq
does not emit another `roll_start`.

a dive with a distinct AABB, finite invuln, and fall-immune landing.
Aerial melee or InputFrame `kick` applies a downward impulse. Dive
tackle and kick hit apply knockdown. A high drop without dive can
hurt. Pit death still kills. Grounded `kick` is blocked. Grounded
sprint+crouch remains a roll.

Product contract: a landed punch applies impulse and may launch.
A knockdown style (kick / dive tackle) enters knockdown, then
get-up. Invuln is tick-exact. A second knockdown while down is
blocked. Punch (not kick) disarms a held gun; the drop has a uid
and is not duplicated. Official death cause is `damage` or `pit`.
Official proof uses `apply_frames` plus live InputEvent inject.

`ledger:RL-MODE-CHAOS` stays `secondary` (2011 developer note) and is

tuning; this WP does **not** ship a copied stat table and does
**not** claim original exact numbers.

Product contract: a dedicated chaos stream (match seed + salt)
rolls crit, knock variance, and pellet jitter when chaos is on.
Live play enables chaos; official VF3-WP1..5 traces stay
chaos-off so their hashes do not drift. Hit damage is capped
(56, per-hit) and per-tick incoming is capped (80). The live
cap proof is a fire-path `overcap_rifle` shot through
`_do_fire` / `take_damage`, not a later `take_damage(999)`
poke. 1000 seeded formula rolls (not live matches) must stay
finite and replay-equal. Slot context fitness is published in
`docs/balance.md` before the batch; the bar is
`win_rate_max < 0.55` and `>=3` distinct `context_best`.
Knife 0.761 / 5-of-5 fails that bar. Soft 0.72 and
`dominates = (win_rate >= 1.0)` are rejected. Five scripted

Product contract: typed PropSpec; named layer/mask contract;
WorldOwner is the only spawn/despawn writer; presentation cannot
mutate; editor/runtime paths stay under the product root; restart
leaves no orphan PropBody; map authoring is catalog placements,
not GameSession node hard-codes. Official proof uses
`apply_frames` plus live InputEvent inject. Live maps do not
receive world placements this WP.

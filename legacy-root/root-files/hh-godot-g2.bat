echo [hh]   4. This run does not sign G2. Play is Alternative (not success).
echo [hh] Revert should use the drive checkpoint of visible.tscn, not snake.
echo [hh] Opening editor: godot\plugin-project
echo [hh] Then starting sidecar + visible drive (no second Godot).
echo [hh] Watch HH Agent Activity: bridge should become connected, timeline fills.
echo [hh] G2 VISIBLE is a HUMAN gate. Do not treat Start as a signed review.

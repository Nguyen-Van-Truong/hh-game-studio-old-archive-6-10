# Legacy Rust / `gs-*` engine archive

This directory is a **pointer only**. The frozen engine tree was not moved here.

## Recovery

- Annotated tag: `legacy-rust-engine-2026-08-20`
- Archive branch: `archive/legacy-rust-engine-2026-08-20`
- Full SHA (`legacy_base_commit`): `698e6088cc6d2c0a9a7b74021de409d46e5971aa`

Recover the engine in a **separate worktree** (checking out the tag on `main`
removes the now-tracked 20-8 plan from the worktree):

```
git worktree add ../hh-game-studio-legacy legacy-rust-engine-2026-08-20
```

or:

```
git worktree add ../hh-game-studio-legacy archive/legacy-rust-engine-2026-08-20
```

Do **not** continue WP-M6 / M7 / M8 of the Rust engine. Do **not** delete this tree.
New product code goes under `godot/` + `bridge/` after later R0 work packages.

## Freeze facts (R0-WP1, 2026-08-20)

HEAD at freeze was already the full Rust engine (354 tracked files). The tag
points at that existing commit. Reboot working-tree files were dirty at freeze
time and are **not** in the tagged tree.

`git status --porcelain=v1` at freeze:

```
 M AGENTS.md
 M docs/DECISIONS.md
?? zdocs/20-8-godot-agent-autopilot-plan.txt
```

Reproducible hashes are **git blobs (LF)**. Windows worktree SHA-256 can differ
because of CRLF smudge; do not treat a worktree digest as the archive id.

A freeze-time worktree SHA-256 `a3c5e706…` for DECISIONS was **not reproducible**
(mixed EOL vs patch vs later WP1 completion). Ignore it.

The freeze-time diff of `AGENTS.md` and pre-pointer `docs/DECISIONS.md` vs the
tagged commit is `legacy/reboot-worktree.patch` (in the R0-WP1 commit, not in
the tag). The 20-8 plan was untracked at freeze, so it is not inside that patch.
It entered git in `50e06934` (user commit of leftover reboot docs; **not** R0-WP2).
